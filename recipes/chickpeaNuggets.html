    <h2>These crispy chickpea nuggets will surely delight any kid or adult! Packed with protein and fiber, they are a healthy alternative to store bought chicken nuggets.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>1 15 oz can of chickpeas drained and rinsed</ul>
    <ul>1/3 block extra firm tofu</ul>
    <ul>1/2 cup oat flour</ul>
    <ul>aquafaba save the chickpea liquid from the can</ul>
    <ul>1 tsp garlic powder</ul>
    <ul>1 tsp onion powder</ul>
    <ul>3/4 tsp salt</ul>
    <ul>sprinkle of smoked paprika</ul>
    <ul>1 cup breadcrumbs of choice if you are gluten-free, use GF breadcrumbs</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain chickpeas with a bowl under it to save the chickpea liquid or "aquafaba". Add chickpeas into the food processor with spices.</li>
        <li>Pulse the chickpeas, tofu, and spices together then add in the oat flour and 2 tbsp of chickpea liquid. Pulse until combined. Do not over blender - it should have texture.</li>
        <li>Make a prep station with a bowl of the breadcrumbs, a bowl with the remaining chickpea liquid and then a plate.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into nugget shapes, dipping each one in the chickpea liquid first then the breadcrumbs. Place them all on the plate. You should get about 10-12 nuggets.</li>
        <li>Air-fryer method: bake for 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees flipping halfway through or until completely golden brown (this is what I did).</li>
        <li>Oven method: Bake on a baking sheet with parchment paper for about 30 minutes at 450 flipping halfway through or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve fresh with ketchup or BBQ sauce and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
